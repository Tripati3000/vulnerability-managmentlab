# What is Vulnerability management? 🤔
Vulnerability management involves identifying and addressing weaknesses in computer systems or networks to prevent cyberattacks. 

**For example** if a software program has a known security flaw that hackers could exploit to gain unauthorized access, vulnerability management would entail regularly updating the software with patches or fixes provided by the manufacturer to close that vulnerability and reduce the risk of a successful cyberattack. Additionally, vulnerability management may involve conducting regular security scans and assessments to identify potential weaknesses before they can be exploited by malicious actors.
