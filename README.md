# What is Vulnerability management? 🤔
Vulnerability management involves identifying and addressing weaknesses in computer systems or networks to prevent cyberattacks. 

**For example** if a software program has a known security flaw that hackers could exploit to gain unauthorized access, vulnerability management would entail regularly updating the software with patches or fixes provided by the manufacturer to close that vulnerability and reduce the risk of a successful cyberattack. Additionally, vulnerability management may involve conducting regular security scans and assessments to identify potential weaknesses before they can be exploited by malicious actors.

# Tools and resources:
 - **[VMware](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html)**
 - **[windows 10 (ISO)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO)**

# Step 4

Now, the above provided steps are without credentials lets check setup with  credentials 👍
 - we are going to Setup **VMware** to be able to accept authenticated scans
 - Provide some credentials to nessus
 - After that we gonna rescan the **VMware** with credentials
 - Compare the results

Open up your VMWARE >>> Search bar >>> Services(Local) >>> Remote Registry >>> Status = Automatic✅ 👇

- Windows
- Current version
- Policies
- system
- Create a new file (LocalAccountFilterPolicy)
- set this value to 1
- then "Ok"
- Close it
- Go and restart your Windows 10 VMware👍

# Step 5 

 Now our window 10 is ready for scan So, Open your windows 10 with your password (Remenber the password)
 - After login go to **Nessus**

# What we learned from our project🤔🔍
 We learned ,
 
 Risk Awareness: We gain a deeper understanding of the vulnerabilities present in our systems and applications, as well as the potential impact they could have on our organization if exploited.
 
 Prioritization: We learn how to prioritize vulnerabilities based on factors such as severity, exploitability, and potential impact on business operations, allowing us to allocate resources more effectively.
 
 Proactive Approach: We understand the importance of taking a proactive approach to cybersecurity by regularly scanning for vulnerabilities, rather than reacting to breaches after they occur.
 
 Collaboration: We recognize the value of collaboration between IT, security teams, and other stakeholders to effectively identify, assess, and remediate vulnerabilities across the organization.Continuous Improvement: We acknowledge that vulnerability management is an ongoing process and that continuous improvement is necessary to adapt to emerging threats and evolving technology landscapes.
 
 Compliance: We learn how vulnerability management practices align with regulatory requirements and industry standards, ensuring that our organization remains compliant and avoids potential fines or penalties.

# Conclusion

 the successful completion of the vulnerability management project has significantly enhanced our organization's cybersecurity posture. Through assessment, prioritization, and remediation of vulnerabilities, we have fortified our defenses against potential threats, minimized risk exposure, and safeguarded sensitive assets. Moving forward, continued vigilance, regular updates, and proactive measures will be essential to sustain this strengthened security framework and adapt to evolving threats in the dynamic digital landscape.
